PORTFOLIO

This project contains my personal details including my skills and some of the projects i have made using python.

To initialise this project you need to have installed :
1. Django is the main requirement
2. time module
3. random module
4. win10toast module

if you have all these modules installed, then go to the command prompt(make sure you are in PORTFOLIO/litesh directory) and run the command python manage.py runserver.

Then you can check my portfolio on localhost:8000 on your web.
